A handfull of helpful codes stuffs (snippets and explanations) to make starting a project easier.

## Dependencies
1. I prefer to use [codekit](https://incident57.com/codekit/) to compile `Sass` and `Jade` files. If you prefer a commandline approach, I recommend [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).
2. [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) -- This configures the Sass directories and adds many useful functions
3.
